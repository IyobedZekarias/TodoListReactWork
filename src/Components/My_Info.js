				My name is Iyobed Zekarias, I have the most beautiful girlfriend in the world.
				She is so kind to me with everything that she does and I don't know how I will ever repay her for all that she does. 
				I just want to make her happy and hopefully that will be enough to satisfy her hunger for my love. 
				Forever mine, Alexandria Brown.
