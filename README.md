## Navigating the code
To find the HTML code and how HTML was used to build this site through JSX, navigate to the /src/components folder and open any file. Inside the file find the render() method and then the return statment inside that method. This is where any HTML code would be located. 

## Todo
This is still a work in progress but is the main component on the site https://IyobedZekarias.github.io/TodoListReactWork . This component highlights a lot about React in that it uses HTML to be built, gets information from an outside file, and has another component, TodoItem passing a string of components into it. 

## The other ones
The other files in the src folder are practice work that I have been working on, they have JSX code in them and run other work. All of them are able to highlight different attributes of what React can do
